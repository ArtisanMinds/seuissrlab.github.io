    Qianqian WANG is current a Professor at the School of Mechanical
    Engineering, Southeast University (SEU), Nanjing, China. He received his
    Ph.D. in Mechanical and Automation Engineering at The Chinese University of
    Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2020. Before joining SEU, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow
    in the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering at CUHK. He has
    published more than 40 papers in peer-reviewed journals, including Science
    Advances, Science Robotics, Nature Communications, ACS Nano and IEEE
    Transactions series (T-CYBER, T-MECH, T-ASE, T-BME), and presented his work
    in IEEE ICRA, IROS .etc. Several of his journal papers have been indexed as
    ESI Highly Cited Papers and Hot Papers (Top 0.1%) and have been highlighted
    in Nature News and international press reports. His research focuses on the
    micro-/nano-robotics field, including collective behaviors of
    micro/nanorobots, medical imaging-guided delivery, and micromanipulation. He
    has been selected into National High-level Young Scholar Program (overseas).
